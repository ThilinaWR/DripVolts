"Harnessing the Power of Rainwater for Sustainable Electricity Generation"
We are developing an innovative system that converts the kinetic and potential energy of rainwater into electricity. By collecting and channeling rainwater through a micro-hydropower setup—such as turbines or piezoelectric surfaces—we aim to provide an eco-friendly, renewable source of energy. This solution is particularly suited for regions with high rainfall and can contribute to decentralized, off-grid power supply, enhancing energy access and sustainability.
